 - write README

 - create get_int(), get_byte() aso. and use them to avoid
   always the same scheme in get_fan_rpm(), get_temp_value(), etc.

 - put device-communication related methods in separate file

 - (evtl.) auto-shorten sensor/fan names by seeking from right
   border to left, hopping over ' ', then setting '\0' to cut

 - write daemon (use notes) for conky-connection through hddtemp
   (the cool stuff ;) )
