 - write README

 - create get_int(), get_byte() aso. and use them to avoid
   always the same scheme in get_fan_rpm(), get_temp_value(), etc.

 - write daemon (use notes) for conky-connection through hddtemp
   (the cool stuff ;) )

 - add "-n" switch for "-f" and "-s" to suppress units, for easy
   integration in bash-scripts, graph-drawing, etc.
