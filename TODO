 - add "-n" switch for "-f" and "-s" to suppress units, for easy
   integration in bash-scripts, graph-drawing, etc.

 - replace arg parsing with stdopts
 
 - use send() from socket.h instead of handmade one... *grml*
 
 - think about MAX_LINE, for security reasons
 
 - implement time synchronization (as the only non-read-only
   function)

 - lots of refactoring ;)
