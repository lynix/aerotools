SUMMARY
----------------
aerotools is a collection of linux programs for getting status information via
USB from the aquaero(R) 4.0 USB device (see AQUAERO). It currently consists of
a CLI (see AEROCLI), a daemon (see AEROD) and a library for the device
communication, which the cli and daemon are built on top of.

aerotools is neither supposed to be a replacement for the existing 'aeinfo' (see
AEINFO), nor to be a complete linux interface for the device. It was written for
retrieving data (sensors, device serial, etc.) from the aquaero(R) device, and
easily integrating it into bash-scripts or conky. Nothing more, nothing less.


AEROCLI
----------------
aerocli can be used to query all useful information the aquaero(R) device holds
("useful" is subjective here, of course) in a non-interactive way, and thus may
be easily integrated in scipts.


AEROD
----------------
The daemon, aerod, was written to integrate the data read from the aquaero(R)
device in any application that can query hddtemp (e.g. using '${hddtemp}' in
conky). Sensor names are represented as virtual nodes under /dev (e.g.
/dev/temp3) for the third temperature sensor.
As hddtemp only provides integers, the reported values are not as precise as
the aquaero(R) provides them.

aerod can act as a transparent proxy for an existing hddtemp instance, so you
don't loose your hddtemp data when using aerod.


AQUAERO
----------------
The aquaero(R) 4.0 USB device is an awesome fan controlling and hardware
monitoring device for water-cooled computer systems, created by the German
company 'Aqua Computer' (http://www.aqua-computer.de). You can find more
information about the device on their website.


AEINFO
----------------
aeinfo is the original linux software, the aquaero(R) comes shipped with. It was
written in C++ by Christian Unger <coder@breakbe.at>. The development seems
currently freezed. You can find more information about aeinfo on the development
website, http://breakbe.at/development/aquaero/.
Unlike aerotools, it was designed to allow not only querying but also changing
settings on the aquaero(R) device.
