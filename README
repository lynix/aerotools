SUMMARY
----------------
aerocli is a collection of command-line tools for getting status information
via USB from the auqaero(R) 4.0 USB device (see AQUAERO). It currently consists
of a client (aerocli, see CLIENT) and a server daemon (aerod, see SERVER).

aerocli is neither supposed to be a replacement for the existing 'aeinfo' (see
AEINFO), nor to be a complete linux interface for the device. It was written
to retrieve sensor data from the aquaero(R) device, and easily integrate it
into bash-scripts or conky. Nothing more, nothing less.


AQUAERO
----------------
The aquaero(R) 4.0 USB device is an awesome fan controlling and hardware
monitoring device for water-cooled computer systems, created by the German
company 'Aqua Computer' (http://www.aqua-computer.de). You can find more
information about the device on their website.


AEINFO
----------------
aeinfo is the original linux software, the aquaero comes shipped with. It was
written in C++ by Christian Unger <coder@breakbe.at>. The development seems
currently freezed. You can find more information about aeinfo on the development
website, http://breakbe.at/development/aquaero/.
Unlike aerocli, it was designed to allow not only querying but also changing
settings on the aquaero(R) device.


CLIENT
----------------
The client, aerocli, can be used to query all useful information the aquaero(R)
device holds ("useful" is subjective here, of course) in a non-interactive way,
and may be easily integrated in scipts.


SERVER
----------------
The server, aerod, was written to integrate the data read from the aquaero(R)
device in conky. It behaves exactly like hddtemp, and can therefore be queried
using conky's ${hddtemp} keyword. Sensor names are represented as virtual nodes
under /dev, e.g. /dev/temp3 for the third temperature sensor.
As hddtemp only provides integers, the reported values are not as precise as
the aquaero(R) can read them.
